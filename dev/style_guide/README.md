# Style Guide


### SASS

The Sass folder contains three files ```layout.scss```, ```vars``` and ```styleguide.scss``` styles in these files should only impact the styleguide itself and should not bleed out to the wider application / site.


##### Vars
Variables that can be shared across elements in the style guide can be placed in here. These variables should not be referenced in the parent site.

##### Layout

The layout scss file is purley for the layout of the style guide. All styles that need to be apply to layout go here.

##### Style Guide

Any styles that are specific to the style guide and do not belong to the layout go in here.
