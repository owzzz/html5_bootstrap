# Style Guide


### SASS

The Sass folder contains two files ```layout.scss``` and ```styleguide.scss``` styles in these files should only impact the styleguide itself and should not bleed out to the wider application / site.

##### Layout

The layout scss file is purley for the layout of the style guide. All styles that need to be apply to layout go here.

##### Style Guide

Any styles that are specific to the style guide and do not belong to the layout go in here.
