		"copy": "Live to Air is a new kind of murder mystery with a new kind of hero, a no nonsense televsion producer who digs for facts and searches for answers. At forty-four, Ethan Benson works at The Weekly Reporter, the most respected newsmagazine on television.  Married with a six-year-old son he adores, he faces a turning point in his long and distinguished career.  His network is coping with a shrinking audience, shorter production deadlines, and tighter budgets, and Ethan is frustrated with the new direction of programming and its reliance on sensational crime stories. Longing for the days when he produced breaking news and in-depth investigative reports that helped make his reputation as a journalist to be reckoned with, he battles with his management and with his mercurial anchorman as he begins to produce his story, confronting his inner demons with a bottle of scotch as he tries to come to grips with the new reality of his life."

		"copy": "Live to Air is as much about the evolution of its hero as the unraveling of a murder mystery. The characters and storyline are based on the real world experiences of the author, Jeffrey L. Diamond, who spent his entire career as a television producer during an era that saw the rise and the decline of network news. Many of the scenes depicted in the novel are drawn from the stories Diamond covered, and many in the cast of characters are modeled on the myriad of professionals he worked with during his long career. Live to Air is an authentic behind-the-scenes picture of network news, and the first in a series of thrillers Diamond intends to write. The second book, Live to Tape, is already finished, and the third, Live to the Network, is in the early stages of research."
