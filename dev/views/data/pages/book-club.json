		"question": "When did you first know you wanted to write a novel?",
		"answer": "I’ve been writing my entire life, hundreds of scripts for television newsmagazine and documentary productions. I’ve also been a voracious reader of all kinds of fiction. About ten years ago, I began wondering whether I could write a novel about my experiences as a producer and a reporter—which is very different from crafting a television script—and when I retired from ABC News a couple of years ago and had all this time to fill, I decided to give it a whirl. That’s when the inspiration really hit, and I sat down and began to write Live to Air."
	}, {
		"question": "Do you follow any particular practices when you’re writing?",
		"answer": "I definitely follow a very set routine. I’m an early riser and like to begin work first thing each day. I’m usually sitting at my desk by eight o’clock and spend four to five hours writing before my brain goes to mush, rarely getting out of my chair except to fetch a cup of coffee or to stretch my legs. My office looks out over a thick forest and majestic rolling hills, so it’s the perfect place to dream up new storylines and plot twists. But, unlike Ethan, who, at times, is scattered and disorganized, I’m a neat freak. Everything in my office is ordered and has its place—except for my golden retriever, Bailey, who’s incorrigible and makes herself comfortable wherever she wants."
	},{
		"question": "Did you have the plot developed to the end, or did the novel unfold in terms of plot as you wrote it?",
		"answer": "This is a great question. I think all writers approach their stories in different ways. I thought about the plotline for Live to Air for quite some time before I sat down and started writing, but I never outlined the book and didn’t have a game plan for the story. What I did have was a beginning and an ending. They were fixed in my mind right from the start, even though the last chapter where Peter Sampson interviews the deputy mayor changed several times before I got it just right. The rest of the book evolved as I was writing, flowing out of my head, changing over and over as I polished the prose and moved around clues to add drama and suspense to the narrative."
	},{
		"question": "Which scenes did you find the most difficult to write?",
		"answer": "I found the Rikers Island prison scenes the most difficult to write, even though I spent a lot of time in and out of lockups during my career. I never visited Rikers Island for any of my stories, so it took a lot of reading and telephone work to come up with a mental picture of the location to use in my book. Most of what I wrote was based on this research, and when I couldn’t answer a question about the physical layout of the prison, I borrowed from what I’d seen at other penal institutions and used my imagination for the rest. I think writers call this “creative license.”"
	},{
		"question": "From early on in the book, it seems that your knowledge of the TV production business is extensive. Is this a business you know well?",
		"answer": "I spent almost forty years working for ABC News, NBC News, FOX News, and Martha Stewart Living Television. I was a writer and producer and experienced many of the big changes that revolutionized TV production during my long career. It’s been my life’s work, and I love every aspect of the business."
	},{
		"question": "Did you base any of the characters in Live to Air on your real-life experiences?",
		"answer": "Everybody who’s read Live to Air asks me this question, and let’s just say that during my career, I produced dozens of high-profile crime stories, where I met gang members, rapists, killers, and serial murderers, and I worked with some of the most famous prosecutors, defense lawyers, detectives, and private investigators in law enforcement. I’ve also collaborated extensively with news correspondents and anchors, production teams, and TV news executives. Yes, all my characters are based on real-life experiences and are a product of the many people who helped me report and produce my stories."
	},{
		"question": "Can you tell us more about the character of Ethan and why he is so unhappy with the general state of journalism?",
		"answer": "Ethan’s unhappiness is something I certainly felt during the last few years of my career. As audiences grew smaller and ratings collapsed, television news began looking for ways to streamline production and save money. For Ethan, serious reporting was the bread and butter of his career, but in his new reality at The Weekly Reporter, with its shorter deadlines, fewer shooting days, and tighter budgets, there was no room for in-depth reporting. Now, don’t get me wrong—I believe strongly that there’s a place in television news for crime stories. I produced many and hope to build a new career based on my experiences, but for Ethan, who sees himself as a hard-nosed journalist, the transition from investigative reporting to crime reporting was difficult to swallow and is an underlying storyline throughout the book."
	},{
		"question": "Ethan does not want to do crime stories and makes it clear in the novel. Is there a particular reason for this aversion?",
		"answer": "Ethan’s sentiments mirror those of many producers who work in television today—especially those who remember an era when newsmagazines like The Weekly Reporter concentrated on hard news and investigative reporting. I found it quite difficult making this transition myself but gradually realized that crime stories serve a unique purpose in the programming of a news broadcast."
	},{
		"question": "Does GBS reflect any place you have previously worked?",
		"answer": " GBS is definitely a synthesis of all the news divisions where I worked. There are scenes in the novel drawn from ABC News, NBC News, Fox News, and many television shows—such as 20/20, Dateline NBC, World News Tonight, and even Martha Stewart Living. In writing Live to Air, I tried to craft the television scenes as authentically as possible—from the types of cameras used in the field to the staffing required to build a set for an interview—and in order to accomplish this and make it seem real, I needed to draw on a treasure trove of experiences from all the networks where I was lucky enough to hang my hat."
	},{
		"question": "When Ethan’s people build the set for the deputy mayor’s interview, they say they’re doing in a couple of hours what usually takes a day. Can you explain what goes into building a set?",
		"answer": "Building a set is a complex process, especially when an anchor is involved in the interview. It usually requires a huge production crew—cameramen, soundmen, lighting directors, electricians, and grips, to name just a few. For a live interview like the deputy mayor’s, cables were run from the set in the deputy mayor’s apartment down to a remote truck on the street, which Ethan used to feed the interview back to the GBS Broadcast Center, where it was switched live to the network. That too had to be built from scratch and staffed by a team of people. The scope of this kind of production is enormous and takes a high level of coordination from every member of the team. My personal experience in constructing a set like the one in Live to Air comes from producing dozens of interviews with Barbara Walters at 20/20. Each and every one required a staff of at least fifteen people and a full production day before we were ready to roll cameras."
	},{
		"question": "Ethan’s instinct seems to be a great and powerful driver in this story. Can you comment on this and how it relates to your own life or career?",
		"answer": "Well, this is difficult to answer. As a producer, my stories were always grounded in the research and based on the sources who fed me information. And like Ethan’s, my stories were built around the facts. But there were always moments during production when I knew I was missing something important and knew that if I just did a little more digging, I’d learn a critical piece of information that would affect my storyline. That’s why I made instinct such a big part of what drives Ethan as a producer. It’s what makes him special and gives him an edge."
	},{
		"question": "Do you identify with Ethan? Who was your favorite character to write?",
		"answer": "This is another great question. Many fictional characters are based on an author’s life experiences. How else can a novelist create a living, breathing hero like Ethan Benson? There are definitely elements of my personality in this character, but having said that, I’ll leave it to the reader’s imagination to figure out which ones they are.  Ms. Templeton has a special place in my heart. At the beginning of my career, I produced dozens of investigative stories on consumer products, military spending, and medical malpractice. And yes, on almost every one of these projects, I had a source like Ms. Templeton who slipped me information under the table. She represents the essence of journalism, the whistleblower who helps Ethan unlock the hidden secrets essential to unraveling his story."
	},{
		"question": "This book seems a bit like a love letter to New York City, and you seem to know the city well. Why did you pick NYC as the setting for your story?",
		"answer": "I picked New York City for a plethora of reasons. I spent forty years living in Manhattan and know all the neighborhoods in Live to Air like the back of my hand. I also spent days on location visiting each community I wrote about, mastering the subtleties and nuances that make them unique. Of course, the television news business is based in the city, and that’s probably the main reason I chose Manhattan as the center of Ethan Benson’s universe."
	},{
		"question": "The scene with Nikolai Stanislov and his prostitute was particularly graphic. How did you come up with this scene?",
		"answer": "Explosive violence is endemic in the world of organized crime. That’s a given. All of us have read about it in newspapers and magazines and seen it on television in shows like The Sopranos. Nikolai Stanislov is an underboss in my fictional Russian crime family. He represents the essence of cruelty and ruthlessness. Short-tempered and explosive on the outside, he is also insecure and vulnerable on the inside. The scene with the prostitute was written to illustrate these personality traits so common in many real-life mobsters and to set up Stanislov’s downfall at the end of the book."
	},{
		"question": "Will there be a sequel?",
		"answer": "Yes. The second Ethan Benson thriller is already finished, and the third book is sitting in the back of my mind, ready to be written in the not-too-distant future."
