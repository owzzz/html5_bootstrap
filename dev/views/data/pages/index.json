	"aboutTheBook": "Live to Air is a gritty crime thriller based in the world of television news with colorful characters and a surprise ending that will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. Its hero is a hard-drinking, chain-smoking producer named Ethan Benson who works for Global Broadcasting, the most powerful network on television. His life is turned upside down when he receives an e-mail from his boss assigning him to a high-profile murder involving the daughter of the deputy mayor of New York who’s been viciously gunned down by a young gang member from a notorious Russian crime family during a botched heroin deal.  Ethan, who’s never produced a tabloid news story in his award-winning career, embarks on an eye-opening journey into the underbelly of New York where he battles cutthroat gangsters and big city politicians. For Ethan, the search for what really happened leaves him questioning his career and his purpose in life, and when the truth is finally revealed in a gut-wrenching interview at the end of the book, he’s left shaken to the core and changed forever."
